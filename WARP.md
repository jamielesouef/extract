# WARP.md

This file provides guidance to WARP (warp.dev) when working with code in this repository.

## Common Commands

- **Build the project:**
  ```bash
  xcodebuild -scheme "extract" -configuration Release
  ```

- **Run tests:**
  ```bash
  xcodebuild test -scheme "extract" -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 14'
  ```

- **Lint the code:**
  
  If a specific linter is set up, use the following command:
  ```bash
  swiftlint
  ```
  Ensure SwiftLint is installed and configured correctly in your project.

## Code Architecture

- The project uses **Xcode** for building and management.
- The configurations include settings for running on **iOS simulators** and **macOS**, indicating a cross-platform compatibility.
- The project deploys with security enhancements like **Hardened Runtime** and **App Sandbox**, ensuring secure operations.
- Swift concurrency is approached with a focus on performance using configurations like `SWIFT_APPROACHABLE_CONCURRENCY`.

When working in this repository, it is important to ensure that the environment is consistent with Xcodeâ€™s settings for both Debug and Release configurations. This allows efficient operation and testing. 

Future instances handling this codebase should ensure they have Xcode and necessary dependencies installed and properly configured.
