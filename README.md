# üì∏ Extract (working name)

**Project Vision**  
Extract gives you full control over your iCloud Photo Library. While Photos is great for browsing and syncing, exporting your entire library to a destination of your choice ‚Äî an external drive, a NAS at home, or cloud storage like Amazon S3 ‚Äî is still awkward. Extract fills that gap with a clean, cross-platform app that makes exporting photos and videos simple, reliable, and future-proof.

## ‚ú® Features
- Runs on **macOS 26, iOS 26, and iPadOS 26**.
- **Browse and select** photos and videos from your iCloud Photo Library.
- **Export anywhere**:
  - Local folders or external drives
  - **NAS** (e.g. SMB shares)
  - **Amazon S3** buckets (more services coming soon)
- **Pull to refresh** to re-scan for newly added items.
- Designed to handle **large libraries** smoothly.

## üõ† Requirements
- macOS 26 / iOS 26 / iPadOS 26 or later
- Xcode 16 or later
- iCloud Photos enabled on the device
- Permissions: Photos access and Files access (for writing to destinations)
- Optional: Network access for NAS shares; S3 credentials with write permissions if exporting to S3

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/<repo>.git
cd extract
open extract.xcodeproj
```

## Run on a MacOS 15+ (Will only support 26 when shipped), iPhone 26, or iPadOS 26 with iCloud Photos enabled.
